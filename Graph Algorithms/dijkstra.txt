1. Fails for negative edges and negative weight cycles
2. Never ends if the graph contains at least one negative cycles
3. Can reach an end if the graph contains negative edges, but no negative cycles; however, it might give wrong results
3. K shortest paths (dist[n][k]) by relaxing the kth distance for a node and sorting the k distances of that node
4. Longest path in directed acyclic graph by taking all edge weights as -1
